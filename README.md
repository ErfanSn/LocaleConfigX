# üí¨ Locale Config X
By providing methods compatible with all Android versions, this library saves you from hardcoding the locales used in the
[per-app language configuration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/app-languages), and in addition, 
it helps in choosing the current language of the app correctly.

## üèóÔ∏è Setup
- Step 1: Add Jitpack repository to dependency repositories in `settings.gradle.kts` 
```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ..
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }
}
```
- Step 2: Add the dependency to build script file
```gradle
dependency {
    implementation("com.github.erfansn:locale-config-x:{latest_version}")
}
```
